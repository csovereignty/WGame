# WGame
A small game project from an idea I had.

The goal of this game will be to use matrices (Representing a game board) to create a sort of "rock-paper-scissors" 2 team game. 

Using C++ mainly as I've not used the language in a little over a year and don't want to lose my recollection of syntax! (Plus I've never done a GUI in C++ yet)

Notes/TODO:
Gonna use the class Board to make multiple boards which will allow us to hide opposing units, then compare the two after a successful (Or unsuccessful) in-game move. Maybe not the most efficient way to do it, but we'll try it  for now.
